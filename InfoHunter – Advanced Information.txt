InfoHunter – Advanced Information Gathering Tool
📌 Introduction

InfoHunter is an advanced, Python-based information gathering and reconnaissance tool inspired by Zenmap and Kali Linux utilities. The tool automates the reconnaissance phase of ethical hacking by accepting a single input (IP address or domain name) and performing multiple scans and enumeration techniques through a menu-driven interface.

🎯 Objective

The main objective of InfoHunter is to simplify and automate reconnaissance tasks such as port scanning, service identification, and domain enumeration. It is designed for CEH practice, cybersecurity training, and academic projects.

▶️ Working Methodology

The user enters a target IP address or domain name.

The tool resolves the target and gathers basic information.

Nmap scans are performed based on user selection.

Enumeration modules collect additional information.

All outputs are saved and compiled into HTML and PDF reports.

⚠️ Ethical Consideration

InfoHunter is developed strictly for educational purposes and authorized security testing. Unauthorized scanning of systems without permission is illegal and not supported.
